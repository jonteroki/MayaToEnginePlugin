# MayaToEnginePlugin
A plugin for Maya that connects the viewport to a stand-alone 3D engine.

The plugin sends vertex and material information from Maya to the engine so that what is shown in the Maya viewport
is shown in real-time in the 3D-engine aswell.

Note that the engine is not included in this repository.
